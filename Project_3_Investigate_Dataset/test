Do not go gentle into that good night. 

And wise men, because they know dark is not right just because it is, 

they do not go gentle into that good night, raging against the dying of the light, 

the failing of human mental flight. 

Rage, rage against the dying light, 
until we conquer nature, within and without, 
else it will conquer us.
